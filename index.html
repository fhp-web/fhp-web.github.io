      Friends of Hagbourne Pool is a charitable organisation whose objective is to support and enhance the swimming provision at Hagbourne CE Primary School.
    </p>

    <p class="py-2 is-size-4">ðŸ’§ Why Are We Fundraising?</p>

    <p class="py-2">
      The school is celebrating its 150th year, and we have had a school pool for over 50 years now.
      It is a valuable asset and we are proud of the schools commitment to making sure swimming lessons are provided from Reception to Year 6 while the pool is open.
      The pool is also well used by local swim schools, community groups and is available for private hire, but it is now in need of some vital TLC.
      Weâ€™re aiming to raise Â£28,000 to replace the pool liner and skimmers and upgrade to a modern air source heat pump to improve efficiency and sustainability.
    </p>

    <p class="py-2">
      The work is planned for the winter closure this year and is essential to secure the pools future for years to come.

      If you have a business and would like to sponsor the much needed upgrades please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>!
    </p>

    <p class="py-2">
      Together, we can make waves for the future of swimming at Hagbourne.
